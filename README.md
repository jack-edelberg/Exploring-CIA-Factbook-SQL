# Exploring-CIA-Factbook-SQL
An introductory data science project demonstrating use of SQLite within a Jupyter environment.

## Conclusions
In this project, I utilized elementary SQL queries to extract population and land-area data from the CIA World Factbook. I identified the following:
* Population
  * **China** is the world's **largest country by population**
  * **The Pitcairn Islands** is the **smallest locale (by population)** tracked in the CIA Factbook.
* Population Growth
  * **Malawi** has the **highest rate of population growth** in the world (excluding immigration and emigration)
  * **Bulgaria** has the **lowest rate of population growth** in the world (excluding immmigration and emigration)
* Population Density
  * **Greenland** has the world's **lowest population density**
  * **Macau** has the world's **highest population density**
  * **Puerto Rico** has the world's highest water-to-land ratio.
